What happens to your body when you have roasted chana every day?

According to Dr Somnath Gupta, senior consultant physician, Yashoda Hospitals, Hyderabad, the protein content in roasted chana supports muscle repair and growth, contributing to overall muscle health.

"The fibre content aids in digestion, promoting a healthy digestive system and helping maintain a regular bowel movement. Roasted chana contains vitamins (e.g., B vitamins) and minerals (e.g., iron, magnesium) that contribute to overall well-being and support various bodily functions," said Dr Gupta.

Dr Dilip Gude, senior consultant physician, Yashoda Hospitals, Hyderabad mentioned that chickpea lentils are not only a great source of dietary (natural) fibre, but they are also protein-rich and have a low glycemic index.
"The absence of cholesterol, the abundance of vitamin B complex, vitamin C, iron, selenium, manganese, calcium, copper, zinc and potassium (coupled with very less sodium) are known to help prevent heart disease. These can also decrease homocysteine and regulate and ensure good blood flow to vital organs by reducing blood clot formation. The magnesium content is optimum as well and helps with electrical activity of the heart (rhythm). These also help in regulating blood pressure," said Dr Gude.
